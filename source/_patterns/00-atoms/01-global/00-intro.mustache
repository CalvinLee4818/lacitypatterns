The Cityâ€™s Web Team has been working on a proposed Style Guide to be used as the go-to style resource for all site and app development.  Not only is this Style Guide supposed to help streamline development, but it should provide great-looking style that can be used by all City Departments while ensuring responsiveness and accessibility.
